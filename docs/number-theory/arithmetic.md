## Factors

### Number of factors of a number

- given number $n$, represent it in prime factors (prime factorization)
- $n = a^p b^q c^r ...$
- $a, b, c$ are prime numbers, and $p, q, r$ are positive numbers
- then total factors are
- $f(n) = (p+1)(q+1)(r+1)...$ where $f(n)$ gives is number of
  factors in $n$

#### Proof

- given number $n$
- represent it in prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- so, $a$ can acquire powers $\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}$, $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = p+1$
- so, $b$ can acquire powers $\{0, 1, 2, ..., q\}$, $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = q+1$
- so, $c$ can acquire powers $\{0, 1, 2, ..., r\}$, $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = r+1$
- and so on, here $n(\text{A})$ is to represent the cardinality of set $\text{A}$
- so total no. of factors are $(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)$

### Number of factors of a number which are even

- should have at least one 2
- given number $n$
- represent it in prime factorization $2^p b^q c^r...$
- so, $a$ can acquire powers $\{1, 2, ..., p\}$, $n(\{1, 2, ..., p\}) = p$
- so, $b$ can acquire powers $\{0, 1, 2, ..., q\}$, $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = q+1$
- so, $c$ can acquire powers $\{0, 1, 2, ..., r\}$, $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = r+1$
- and so on, here $n(\text{A})$ is to represent the cardinality of set $\text{A}$
- so total no. of even factors are $(p)(q+1)(r+1)$

### Number of factors which are perfect square

- given number $n$
- represent it in prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- so, $a$ can acquire powers $\{0, 2, 4, ..., p\}$,
  $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = \lceil{\frac{p+1}{2}}\rceil$
- so, $b$ can acquire powers $\{0, 2, 4, ..., q\}$,
  $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = \lceil{\frac{q+1}{2}}\rceil$
- so, $c$ can acquire powers $\{0, 2, 4, ..., r\}$,
  $n(\{0, 1, 2, ..., p\}) = \lceil{\frac{r+1}{2}}\rceil$
- and so on, here $n(\text{A})$ is to represent the cardinality of set $\text{A}$
- so total no. of factors are

### Products of factors of a number

- $g(n) = n^{f(n)/2}$, $f(n)$ is number of factors of $n$

### Number of ways of expressing a number as product of two numbers

- given, $n$ and its prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- $f(n) = (p+1)(q+1)(r+1)...$
- $F(n) = \frac{1}{2}f(n)$,
    - is not possible when $f(n)$ is odd
    - if, $p, q, r,...$ are all even then $n$ is a prefect square
        - that means that $\sqrt{n}$ is a whole no.
        - therefore $F(n) = \frac{1}{2}f(n) - 1$,
      $\sqrt{n} \times \sqrt{n}$ is not counted

### Sum of all factors of a number

- given, $n$ and its prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- sum is

$$\frac{a^{p+1} - 1}{a-1} \frac{b^{q+1} - 1}{b-1} \frac{c^{r+1} - 1}{c-1} ...$$

### Number of ways of writing a number as product of two co-primes

- **co-primes** - there gcd (hcf) is 1
- given, $n$ and its prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- $n(\{a, b, c, ...\}) = x$, i.e. no of unique prime in prime factorization is $x$
- then, total no of co-primes are $2^{x-1}$

### Number of coprimes to $n$ that are less than $n$

- given, $n$ and its prime factorization $a^p b^q c^r...$
- then,
  $$
  \phi(n) = n\Big(1-\frac{1}{a}\Big) \Big(1-\frac{1}{b} \Big) \Big(1-\frac{1}{c}\Big)
  $$
- so number of coprimes to $n$ that are less than $n$ are:
    - $\frac{n}{2} \times \phi(n)$

### Number of factors

$$
\left\lceil\frac{p+1}{2}\right\rceil
\left\lceil\frac{q+1}{2}\right\rceil
\left\lceil\frac{r+1}{2}\right\rceil
$$

### Number of factors of $n$ and $m$ that are common

- $n = a^p b^q c^r...$
- $m = a^l b^m c^n...$
- total no of common factors are
  $(\min(p, l) + 1) \times (\min(q, m) + 1) \times (\min(r, m) + 1) ...$
