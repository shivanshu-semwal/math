# Differential Equations

## Ist order equations

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y)
$$

### Types

- Variable Separable
- Homogeneous Equations
- Reducible to Homogeneous
- Exact Differential Equations
- Reducible to Exact
    - Using Integration Factor
- Linear Equation
- Reducible to Linear
    - Bernoulli's equation

### Application

- Netwon's law of cooling

## Higher order Linear Differential Equations

General case,
$$
y^{(n)} + p_1y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + p_ny = f(x)
$$

With constant coefficients,

$$
y^{(n)} + k_1y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + k_ny = f(x)
$$
