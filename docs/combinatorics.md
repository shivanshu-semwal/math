# Combinatorics

## Inclusion Exclusion Principle

- $A$ can occur in $n$ ways
- $B$ can occur in $m$ ways
- $A$ and $B$ can occur in $n \times m$ ways
- $A$ or $B$ can occur in $n + m$ ways

## Permutations

$$
P(n, k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

- no of permutations of $n$ things taken all at a time where
  $p$ things are identical and $q$ things are identical
  $$
  \frac{n!}{p!q!}
  $$
- $n$ identical things to be distributed to $r$ boxes,
  no of ways
  $$
  C^{n+r-1}_{r-1}
  $$
  Same as lining all the $n+r-1$ items and the selecting
  $r-1$ and remove them, which will give you $r$ partitions.

## Combinations

$$
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \binom{n}{k}
$$

- no of handshakes
    - $n$ people in the room
    - everyone shakes hand with everyone else
    - sol. $C^n_2$
- no of matches
    - $n$ teams
    - every team play one match with every other team
    - sol. $C^n_2$
- no of line
    - $n$ points in a plane
    - no three points are in straight line
    - sol. $C^n_2$
- no of line
    - $n$ points in a plane
    - $m$ points are collinear and already in straight line
    - sol. $C^n_2 - C^m_2 + 1$
    - sol. $C^{n-m}_2 + m(n-m) + 1$
- no of diagonals
    - $n$ vertices of a regular polygon
    - sol. $C^n_2 - n$
- no of square and rectangle
    - a $n \times m$ grid
    - for rec we need 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines
    - no of rectangles - $C^n_2 \times C^m_2$
    - no of squares - $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... + \text{min}(n, m)^2$

Total no of combinations of things taken 0 at a time or some or all at a time $2^n$
