## Outline

- Pure and [applied mathematics](applied-mathematics/README.md)
- Areas of Mathematics (borrowed from wiki)
    - [Number theory](number-theory/README.md)
    - [Geometry](geometry-and-topology/README.md)
        - Projective geometry, introduced in the 16th century by Girard Desargues, extends Euclidean geometry by adding points at infinity at which parallel lines intersect. This simplifies many aspects of classical geometry by unifying the treatments for intersecting and parallel lines.
        - Affine geometry, the study of properties relative to parallelism and independent from the concept of length.
        - Differential geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using differentiable functions.
        - Manifold theory, the study of shapes that are not necessarily embedded in a larger space.
        - Riemannian geometry, the study of distance properties in curved spaces.
        - Algebraic geometry, the study of curves, surfaces, and their generalizations, which are defined using polynomials.
        - Topology, the study of properties that are kept under continuous deformations.
            - Algebraic topology, the use in topology of algebraic methods, mainly homological algebra.
        - Discrete geometry, the study of finite configurations in geometry.
        - Convex geometry, the study of convex sets, which takes its importance from its applications in optimization.
        - Complex geometry, the geometry obtained by replacing real numbers with complex numbers.
    - [Algebra](algebra/README.md)
        - group theory;
        - field theory;
        - vector spaces, whose study is essentially the same as linear algebra;
        - ring theory;
        - commutative algebra, which is the study of commutative rings, includes the study of polynomials, and is a foundational part of algebraic geometry;
        - homological algebra;
        - Lie algebra and Lie group theory;
        - Boolean algebra, which is widely used for the study of the logical structure of computers.
    - [Calculus and Analysis](analysis/calculus/README.md)
        - Multivariable calculus
        - Functional analysis, where variables represent varying functions;
        - Integration, measure theory and potential theory, all strongly related with probability theory on a continuum;
        - Ordinary differential equations;
        - Partial differential equations;
        - Numerical analysis, mainly devoted to the computation on computers of solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in many applications.
    - [Discrete Mathematics](discrete-mathematics/README.md)
        - Graph theory and hypergraphs
        - Coding theory, including error correcting codes and a part of cryptography
        - Matroid theory
        - Discrete geometry
        - Discrete probability distributions
        - Game theory (although continuous games are also studied, most common games, such as chess and poker are discrete)
        - Discrete optimization, including combinatorial optimization, integer programming, constraint programming
    - [Mathematical logic and set theory](foundations/README.md)
    - [Statistics and other decision sciences](applied-mathematics/statistics.md)
    - Computational mathematics
